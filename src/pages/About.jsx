          <h2>A Fusion of Engineering and Design</h2>
          <p>
            I am Chukwubuokem engineer by training, developer by craft, athlete
            by habit, and builder by purpose. I earned a B.Eng. in Marine
            Engineering (Second Class Upper) from the Federal University of
            Petroleum Resources, Effurun (FUPRE), and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a
            Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Aston University, Birmingham. I grew
            up fascinated by systems: how engines convert fuel into motion, how
            code becomes product, how a body turns training into performance,
            and how communities transform ideas into opportunity. That curiosity
            is still my compass.
          </p>

          <h2>Early Curiosity - Systems Thinking</h2>
          <p>
            As a kid, I took things apart (radios, fans, toys) just to see how
            the pieces made sense together. Marine engineering sharpened that
            instinct into discipline: thermodynamics, propulsion, reliability,
            safety, and optimization. Software development expanded it further:
            data structures, UI/UX ergonomics, APIs, distributed systems, and
            product strategy. Sport gave me a feedback loop for improvement:
            train, measure, adjust, repeat. Health care taught me empathy and
            responsibility. These four lenses
            <strong>engineering, software, sport, and health</strong> are now
            the foundation of everything I build.
          </p>

          <h2>Engineering Foundation</h2>
          <p>
            Marine engineering taught me to think in <strong>lifecycles</strong>{" "}
            from specification to operation, maintenance, and continuous
            improvement. It trained me to spot failure modes, design for
            constraints, and prioritize the essentials: safety, efficiency, and
            sustainability. Those same habits now show up in my code reviews, my
            database design, my release plans, and my leadership style.
          </p>

          <h2>Becoming a Developer</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I'm a work in progress, building end-to-end products with
            JavaScript/TypeScript, React & React Native, Node.js/Express, and
            Python. Iâ€™m comfortable from data modeling (Postgres/PostGIS) and
            API design to mobile UI/UX, offline-first patterns, and DevOps. I
            care deeply about design systems, accessibility, and code quality. I
            enjoy turning ambiguous ideas into shippable, documented
            featuresâ€”and I maintain a component library for reuse and
            consistency.
          </p>

          <h2>Athlete & Competitor</h2>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a sprinter in the <strong>100m, 200m, and 400m.</strong>{" "}
            Training taught me discipline and patience, but also timing: not
            every day is a personal best, and thatâ€™s okay. You stack good days
            until the clock notices. My targets are specific, my logs are
            meticulous, and I use video, drills, and phase planning to track
            progress. The through line from the track to tech is simple:{" "}
            <strong>consistency beats intensity when sustained.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>Health, Care, and Human-Centered Work</h2>
          <p>
            Coming from a family with my Mom as a nurse with hands-on experience
            in drug administration, caregiving, therapy, wellness coaching, and
            physical rehabilitation. Health care sharpened my ability to listen,
            to explain, and to put people at easeâ€”skills that translate directly
            into product discovery, user interviews, and team leadership. When I
            design flows, Iâ€™m thinking about cognitive load, clarity, and the
            stakes if we get something wrong.
